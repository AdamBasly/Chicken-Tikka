# 🐔 Chicken-Tikka Classifier

A convolutional neural network that classifies images as **chicken**, **cow**, or **car**.

⚠️ **Not for production use.**  
We don’t want car tikka. Or cow curry. Or roasted headlights.

### Accuracy: 97%  
### Purpose: Absurd brilliance  
### Model type: Custom CNN (no pretrained weights)

---

## 🧪 How it works

- Trained on real images of chickens, cows, and cars
- Uses a handcrafted CNN architecture
- Evaluated with live progress via `tqdm`
- Saved as `.h5` and TensorFlow SavedModel

---

## 🧠 Why?

Because someone had to do it.  
Because not every model needs a purpose.  
Because sometimes, you just want to know if that thing in the field is edible or driveable.
